ArloBot Parallax Libraries
==========================

This folder contains the arlobot libraries from Parallax that are required in order to run the Propeller C code in this package.
These are the exact same files available here:

I just put them here for my convenience.
If you installed SimpleIDE in the default way, then you can run the script:
```
PutFilesInPlace.sh
```
from here, which should put all of these files into your SimpleIDE workspace so that
ROS Interface for ArloBot.c
will build.
